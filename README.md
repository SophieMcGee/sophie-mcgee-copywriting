# User Experience (UX)

## Client Background & Goals


As the website will be used to promote my own services, in this situation I am the client. I hold a degree in marketing and have more than 10 years of experience working as a marketing manager alongside providing copywriting services. In the past I have offered my services through gig-style platforms that are popular with freelancers, and I have also benefitted from client referrals. The goals for this website are:
* To attract new clients – I want the website to attract my target clients, with services, pricing and testimonials listed that appeal to their needs and challenges.
* Establish professionalism and credibility – The website should convey a professional and trustworthy image through a polished website design, consistent branding, and a clean layout.
* The website should clearly outline the range of copywriting services I offer, to promote my copywriting services effectively.
* It should include clear calls-to-action (CTAs) strategically placed throughout the website to encourage visitors to get in touch or enquire about my services. In addition, the website needs to provide multiple contact options, such as a contact form and social media links to make it easy for potential clients to reach out.

## Market Research

In the initial stages of designing and developing this website, comprehensive market research was conducted to not only understand the industry landscape but also to align the website with the preferences and expectations of clients who are looking for copywriting services on a casual, remote basis.

### 1. Industry Overview

A thorough examination of the copywriting industry provided insights into emerging trends, client preferences, and the evolving dynamics of gig-style platforms. Understanding the unique characteristics of this sector influenced decisions on how to tailor services to meet the specific needs of clients seeking quick and efficient copywriting solutions.

#### Design Implications

* The website will feature a modern, simple design that reflects the fast-paced nature of the copywriting industry.
* Emphasis on clear visuals and concise content to quickly communicate key information such as services and pricing.

### 2. Competitor Analysis

An in-depth analysis of competitors in both traditional copywriting and gig-style platforms was undertaken. By evaluating their pricing structures, service offerings, and client engagement models, I sought to position this website as a streamlined alternative, delivering transparent and straightforward copywriting services.
The competitor websites analysed were:
* [Stray Dog](https://www.straydog.ie/copywriter-dublin/)
* [O’Connell Copy](https://oconnellcopy.com/)
* [Bankhouse Media](https://www.bankhousemedia.ie/digital-media-services/copy-writing/)
* [SEO Agency Ireland](https://seoagencyireland.ie/copy-writing)
* [Passion for Creative](https://www.passionforcreative.com/services/marketing/copywriting/)
* [People Per Hour](https://www.peopleperhour.com/hire-freelancers/writing-translation/copywriters)
* [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/hire/copywriters/ie/)


#### Design Implications

* The website design will emphasise simplicity and clarity, offering a clean layout that makes it easy for users to view services, the process and clear pricing.
* Visual elements will showcase these unique elements which will set this website apart from competitors.
