# User Experience (UX)

## Client Background and Goals


As the website will be used to promote my own services, in this situation I am the client. I hold a degree in marketing and have more than 10 years of experience working as a marketing manager alongside providing copywriting services. In the past I have offered my services through gig-style platforms that are popular with freelancers, and I have also benefitted from client referrals. The goals for this website are:

* To attract new clients – I want the website to attract my target clients, with services, pricing and testimonials listed that appeal to their needs and challenges.
* Establish professionalism and credibility – The website should convey a professional and trustworthy image through a polished website design, consistent branding, and a clean layout.
* The website should clearly outline the range of copywriting services I offer, to promote my copywriting services effectively.
* It should include clear calls-to-action (CTAs) strategically placed throughout the website to encourage visitors to get in touch or enquire about my services. In addition, the website needs to provide multiple contact options, such as a contact form and social media links to make it easy for potential clients to reach out.

## Market Research

Following the initial stages of user research for this website, comprehensive market research was conducted to not only understand the industry landscape but also to align the website with the preferences and expectations of my target clients who are looking for copywriting services on a casual, remote basis. A thorough examination of the copywriting industry provided insights into emerging trends, client preferences, and the evolving dynamics of gig-style platforms. Understanding the unique characteristics of this sector provided the insight needed to make design decisions based on the specific needs of the target clients. The following were the key areas of market research which will influence the design process:

### 1. Competitor Analysis

An in-depth analysis of competitors in both traditional copywriting and gig-style platforms was undertaken. By evaluating their pricing structures, service offerings, and client engagement models, I sought to position this website as a streamlined alternative, delivering transparent and straightforward copywriting services.
The competitor websites analysed were:
* [Stray Dog](https://www.straydog.ie/copywriter-dublin/)
* [O’Connell Copy](https://oconnellcopy.com/)
* [Bankhouse Media](https://www.bankhousemedia.ie/digital-media-services/copy-writing/)
* [SEO Agency Ireland](https://seoagencyireland.ie/copy-writing)
* [Passion for Creative](https://www.passionforcreative.com/services/marketing/copywriting/)
* [People Per Hour](https://www.peopleperhour.com/hire-freelancers/writing-translation/copywriters)
* [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/hire/copywriters/ie/)


#### Design Implications

* The website design will emphasise simplicity and clarity, offering a clean layout that makes it easy for users to view services, the process and clear pricing.
* Visual elements will showcase these unique elements which will set this website apart from competitors.

### 2. Pricing Requirements

Given the preference for simplicity and clarity in pricing, the website which stood out in my research were designed to provide clear and concise information about pricing. This clearly aligns with the expectations of clients who appreciate a straightforward process.

#### Design Implications

* A dedicated section on both the homepage and services page on the website will clearly outline the pricing structure based on the number of words, providing transparency and facilitating easy budgeting for clients.
* Visual elements, such as pricing tables will be incorporated for an intuitive understanding of the cost implications.

### 3. Client Testimonials

Examining client testimonials and feedback within competitors websites provided valuable insights into the expectations and experiences of clients seeking copywriting services. This feedback informed decisions on how to present client testimonials on the website to resonate with the target audience.

#### Design Implications

* Testimonials from clients who I have worked with in the past will be strategically placed, emphasising the positive impact of my services.

### 4. Streamlined Contact Process

My research found that target clients have a preference for efficiency, with the ideal website designs incorporating clear contact forms for submitting copywriting requests. This combined with quick turnarounds and a user-friendly interface cater to clients need for a straightforward and time-effective transaction process.

#### Design Implications

* The website pages will feature call to action links to  guide users through to a simple contact form to submit copywriting requests, ensuring a quick and efficient experience.
* The contact form will feature in the footer of each page, ensuring it can be easily found for users scrolling on all screen sizes without having to navigate to a seperate page.
